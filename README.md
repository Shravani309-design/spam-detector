📧 AI-Powered Email Spam Classifier
🧠 Introduction
With the rise of digital communication, email has become a primary channel for both personal and business correspondence. However, this has also opened the door to spam emails, which range from annoying advertisements to dangerous phishing attacks. Manually filtering such emails is time-consuming and prone to error.
This project demonstrates a Machine Learning-based solution for classifying emails as either spam or ham (legitimate) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Logistic Regression model. It uses the Bag of Words (BoW) technique via CountVectorizer to convert email messages into numeric features suitable for classification.

❓ Problem Statement
Spam detection is a critical task in modern communication systems. The objective of this project is to create a lightweight yet efficient email classifier that:
•	Analyzes the textual content of emails.
•	Identifies whether a message is spam or ham.
•	Provides a confidence score for predictions.
•	Can be easily extended or integrated into larger applications like email clients or spam filters.

🗂️ Project Setup
📌 Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed, along with the required libraries:
pip install pandas scikit-learn
📁 File Structure
spam-email-classifier/
│
├── email (1).csv              # Dataset with 'Category' and 'Message' columns
├── spam_classifier.py         # Main script with all logic
└── README.md                  # Project documentation (this file)
📝 Dataset Format
Your email (1).csv should have at least two columns:

🚀 How to Run
1.	Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-email-classifier.git
cd spam-email-classifier
2.	Place the dataset:
Ensure that email (1).csv is in the project directory.
3.	Run the classifier:
python spam_classifier.py
The script will:
•	Load and clean the dataset.
•	Train a logistic regression model.
•	Evaluate the model's performance.
•	Predict whether sample emails are spam or ham.
